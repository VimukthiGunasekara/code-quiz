## Minor Bug

    Even the quiz works fine, I couldn´t get rid of this two errors (Didn´t have enough time to work more on them):

    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null
        at high.js:33
    
    
    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of null
        at printHighScore (high.js:20)
        at high.js:10
        
    Media queries need to be fixed 100% (Not enough time)
